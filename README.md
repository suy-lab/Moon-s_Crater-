# Moon-s_Crater-
An AI/ML model to detect craters/boulders of all shapes and sizes from the given OHRC data.

# Objectives:-
Design a model which is capable of automatically detecting all craters/boulders in an OHRC irrespective of their shape, size and illumination conditions.
Model is able to quantify the selenographic position and diameter of the detected crater/boulder.
